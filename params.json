{"name":"Guitarparty-Cocoa","tagline":"A client library for guitarparty.com, written in Swift, for iOS and OS X","body":"![Guitarparty Logo](http://guitarparty-static-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/v3/body/logo.6329ffbed64d.png)\r\n\r\n# Welcome. \r\nWelcome to the **Guitarparty iOS and OS X Client Library**. This library enables developers to access the plethora of chords and tabs in the [Guitarparty.com](http://www.guitarparty.com) database.\r\n\r\nI wrote this library in the midst of my exploration of the new Swift language developed by Apple. So enjoy, catch bugs, submit pull requests, and make use of this library as much as you need.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- **Xcode 6.1** (*works beautifully with Swift 1.1; I will update whenever Swift changes and recompile to make sure everything works.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n- **iOS 8+** (*Dynamic frameworks will not compile on anything lower.*)\r\n\r\n\t*or:*\r\n- **OS X 10.9+** (*Swift is compatible with as early as Mavericks*)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo quote [Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt):\r\n> The infrastructure and best practices for distributing Swift libraries is currently in flux during this beta period of the language and Xcode.\r\n\r\nSo, because of this, what should you do? I recommend adding the Guitarparty repository as a git submodule (an example of which is at the beginning of [this article](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/wiki/Installing-RestKit-v0.20.x-as-a-Git-Submodule \"Adding RestKit as a Git Submodule\")) and then adding Guitarparty.xcodeproj as a subproject to your Xcode project. Then link either the **Guitarparty.framework** (iOS) or **GuitarpartyOSX.framework** (OS X) to your app target.\r\n\r\n## API Key\r\n**Before you do anything else with this library,** you need to grab an API key from http://www.guitarparty.com/developers/api-key/\r\n\r\nThen call the Guitarparty class's setAPIKey() method to set the API Key for all requests:\r\n\r\n**Swift**\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n\tGuitarparty.setAPIKey(\"{API_KEY}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Objective-C**\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n\t[Guitarparty setAPIKey:@\"{API_KEY}\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nThis library contains **4 Object Categories**:\r\n\r\n- [Songs](http://www.guitarparty.com/developers/api-docs/api-resources/songs/)\r\n- [Artists](http://www.guitarparty.com/developers/api-docs/api-resources/artists/)\r\n- [Parties](http://www.guitarparty.com/developers/api-docs/api-resources/parties/)\r\n- [Chords](http://www.guitarparty.com/developers/api-docs/api-resources/chords/)\r\n\r\nEach category contains the **object** itself, a **list** object, and a **fetcher** object with the possible ways to query the object category.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's how to search for songs with a query string: \r\n\r\n**Swift:**\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nSongFetcher.searchForSongs(query: \"Jolene\") { (results: SongList?, error: NSError?) in\r\n            if error != nil {\r\n                // Handle error here\r\n            } else {\r\n                if results != nil { // Check to make sure there is in fact a song list\r\n                    self.songList = results!\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }   \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Objective-C**\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n[SongFetcher searchForSongsWithQuery:@\"Jolene\" completionHandler:^(SongList *results, NSError *error) {\r\n        if (error) {\r\n            // Handle error here\r\n        } else {\r\n            if (results) { // Check to make sure there is in fact a song list\r\n                self.songList = results\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThis library is well-documented using the standard in-line documentation methods. So quick-looking any symbol in this SDK will give you documentation for that item.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright 2014 Matthew Wyskiel\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
